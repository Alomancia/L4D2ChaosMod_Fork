# L4D2 Chaos Mod

## Introduction

Inspired by the chaos mods made for the Grand Theft Auto series - I decided to make a version for Left 4 Dead 2. The idea behind Chaos Mod is to enable random effects at regular intervals during play. This can result in some funny situations which will only get more varied as I add more effects.

This mod is intended to be run as a sourcemod plugin on a dedicated server. This means it's possible to have a full server of people playing with the mod enabled. Note that only the server needs the mod installed and the clients can join with a vanilla copy of Left 4 Dead 2.
